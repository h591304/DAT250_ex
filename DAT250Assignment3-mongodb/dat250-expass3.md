# dat250_MongoDB_ex3
Report for the third dat250 assignment

### Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved

The only minor problem I had was a pathing problem regarding the use of mongodb shell that didn't work at first, but then i just put it in the same directory as mongodb enterprice and it worked somehow despite the fact that I had both paths added to environment variables.

### Screenshots for experiment 1 and 2.

Check the "Screenshots_assignment3" folder for all results.

### Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.

I inserted a few more entries to the pizzas collection and used map-reduce to calculate the total price of all pizzas in the collection. The implementation is useful since it illustrates the fundamental concepts of map-reduce in a way that's easy to understand.
